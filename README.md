# Baseball_Public
 Baseball analytics files using R, SQL, and Python. The data is downloaded via a SQL server, baseball.computer, inside Python and R files and then I manipulate, transform, and visualize it for personal and public consumption. 

S23_Summary.py is a brief demonstration of my SQL skills. I download players from the 2023 rosters list, find the unique players - if a player switched teams they will appear twice - and then aggregate their hits and homeruns for the 2020 - 2024 baseball regular season. 

S23_Events_Count_Notebook.ipynb is a demonstration of my Python skills. The end goal of segment of the project is to be able to find any player's offensive or pitching statistics when in any pitching count across the whole season, an individual game, or across a stretch of games. Statistics are aggregated to resemble tables similarly used on Fangraphs.com and Baseball-Reference.com. The pitching data aggregation is not finished but will follow a similar format to the hitting functions. Remaining for offensive stats are runs scored (R), runs batted in (RBI), steals (S), and caught stealing (CS). The interactive component of this is not set up yet. One last stipulation is that that a function is needed to let the user search for players and timespans.
